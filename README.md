Work done by me includes inclusion of the level maps ,enemies & rewards & completion of level map(room), scripting of player & the first person camera for the player to the game. I also assisted my other team-mates during their part of the work and removed a lot of bugs which came in course of building of game. Apart from that, it was me who came up with the design and working of game including how the second level will be implemented.
